# Node.js Design Patterns (Third Edition) Exercises

This repop contains some of the exercises I tried to complete after following the book.

To run each exercise go to each chapter and run specific node scripts

```sh
cd 04-asynchronous-control-flow-patterns-with-callbacks

# run example 4.1-concat-files.js
node 4.1-concat-files.js
```
